# POVDataset



PVOD has total 271,968 records and is constructed from two data sources with a 15-min interval, namely, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) from meteorological service and Local Measurements Data (LMD) from PV power stations. 

- NWP includes 7 features, i.e., global irradiance, direct irradiance, temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and pressure.
- Local Measurements Data includes 7 features, i.e., global irradiance, diffuse irradiance, temperature, pressure, wind direction, wind speed, and photovoltaic output records.
